## 🤯 The problem

Every finance student learns Aswath Damodaran's DCF framework. Every investment analyst ends up in a 40-tab Excel workbook that nobody understands, not even its author 6 months later. The math is correct but the provenance is lost — **where did that β come from? Is the WACC in USD or HKD? What happens if we change the ERP approach? Why does NVDA's D/E look wrong?**

Spreadsheets answer none of these questions. Their authors often can't either.

## 💡 What this does

**Reimplements Damodaran's *Ginzu* valuation workbook as a modern web application** where:

| Spreadsheet says | This app says |
|---|---|
| `1.62` | `β_L = β_u × [1 + (1−t) × D/E] = 1.325 × [1 + 0.835 × 0.304] = 1.62` *(hover tooltip)* |
| `5.52%` | `ERP = 0.45×4.33% (US) + 0.22×5.41% (China) + 0.18×6.51% (EMEA composite) + …` |
| `$2.37` | `VPS = $2.37 USD (≈ HK$18.49 at 7.78 HKD/USD, CIQ, 2025-06-30)` |
| `#REF!` | `⚠ Segment "Rest of World" needs your input — pick from 180 countries or 10 regions` |

Every number is traceable. Every methodology is a live dropdown. Switch the ERP approach from "country of incorporation" to "operating countries" — watch β, Ke, WACC, and VPS recompute in real time. Upload a financial data workbook, get a defensible DCF in seconds.

---

## ⚡ What makes this different

### 🔍 Full provenance on every cell
Hover any monetary or ratio cell in the app. Get the data-source mnemonic, the Damodaran file + column, or the exact computational formula. No more "trust me, it's right."

### 🧭 Every Ginzu methodology choice, exposed
Damodaran's model offers **4 WACC approaches × 6 β variants × 4 ERP variants × 4 Kd variants** = 384 possible paths. This app implements them all. Switch between them with a dropdown; the entire downstream valuation re-runs.

### 🌏 Works for any company, anywhere
- **180 countries** with their ERPs, CRPs, and tax rates loaded from Damodaran's live datasets
- **95 industries** — US and Global — with β_u, β_L, WACC, D/E, ROIC, and margin benchmarks
- **10 Damodaran regional aggregates** (North America, Western Europe, Asia, Africa, …) for operating-countries ERP blending
- **Automatic currency conversion** when the reporting currency differs from the listing currency (e.g., Lenovo reports USD but trades HKD — this matters for WACC)
- **Geographic revenue segments** auto-mapped: type "EMEA" in a segment, the resolver expands it to a weighted blend of Western Europe + Eastern Europe + Middle East + Africa

### 🛟 Graceful fallback — never a wall
Data missing? Industry not in Damodaran's classification? Exchange prefix unknown? FX rate unavailable? **The valuation still runs with safe defaults and surfaces every unresolved gap** through a single `UnresolvedFieldsPanel` at the top of every page. Pick from the dropdown, the valuation re-runs. No dead-ends.

### 📖 Methodology, documented in English
Every calculation module has a companion financial-reasoning doc in [`docs/Ginzu understanding/`](docs/Ginzu%20understanding/README.md) explaining *why* each step is structured the way it is. Not just code — a learning resource for anyone studying DCF seriously.

### ✅ 83 tests passing
Every M1–M6 arithmetic module tested against hand-calculated expected values, plus end-to-end integration tests across representative companies.

## 🎯 It matches Damodaran's published numbers

To prove the engine is faithful: feed it **the exact same inputs Damodaran uses for his NVIDIA valuation workbook** and compare.

<div align="center">

| Metric | 🧮 This engine | 📊 Damodaran's Ginzu | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **β_u** (unlevered beta) | 1.4600 | 1.4602 | −0.01% |
| **β_L** (levered beta) | 1.4637 | 1.4635 | +0.01% |
| **ERP used** | 4.86% | 4.86% | — |
| **Kd pre-tax** | 6.12% | 6.12% | — |
| **WACC** | **11.79%** | **11.79%** | **~0%** ✓ |
| Value of operating assets | $1,767,969 M | $1,867,813 M | −5.3% |
| Value of equity | $1,798,468 M | $1,898,312 M | −5.3% |
| **Value per share** | **$73.44** | **$77.51** | −5.3% |
| Market price | $123.00 | $123.00 | — |
| Verdict | Overvalued on DCF | Overvalued on DCF | ✓ |

</div>

**WACC matches to the fourth decimal.** The residual ~5% on VPS is the only remaining gap — and it's *architectural*, not a bug: Damodaran's NVDA workbook splits the valuation into three business stories (Rest of NVIDIA + AI Chip + Auto Chip) and sums them. This engine runs a single consolidated DCF. Adding multi-story DCF is on the [roadmap](#-roadmap).

Both engines agree: **NVIDIA is overvalued on DCF** (market trades at 1.59–1.67× intrinsic value on Damodaran's default assumptions). The engine reproduces his headline conclusion with math that's byte-for-byte verifiable.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+**
- **Node.js 18+**

That's it. The repo ships with:
- A **pre-built company database** of ~13,000 public firms across US / China / Hong Kong exchanges (10 years annual + 8 quarters of financials).
- **Damodaran's annual reference tables** (betas, industry margins, country risk premia, tax rates — all 220+ files).
- A **ticker → industry lookup** for 800+ names.

Clone, install, run, value. No data prep required.

### Three commands

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/chrisuzy/Investment_Valuation_Agent.git
cd Investment_Valuation_Agent

# 2. Install
(cd backend && python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e .)
(cd frontend && npm install)

# 3. Run
(cd backend && source .venv/bin/activate && uvicorn api.main:app --port 8000) &
(cd frontend && npm run dev)
```

Open `http://localhost:5173/`. Search a ticker (try `Tencent`, `AAPL`, `SEHK:992` for Lenovo, `SHSE:600519` for Moutai). Click **⚡ Value from Database**. Full DCF in under a second.

**For tickers outside the shipped dataset** (emerging-market single names, rare OTC, new IPOs): download the pre-filled data-fetch template, run it through your own data provider (Capital IQ / Bloomberg / FactSet / manual), drop the filled file back on the upload screen. The [`docs/DATA_FETCH_SCHEMA.md`](docs/DATA_FETCH_SCHEMA.md) spec documents the expected columns.

**→ Full walkthrough:** [**Tutorial — Value Microsoft in 5 minutes**](docs/TUTORIAL.md)

### Optional: admin mode (batch data management)

A maintainer-facing **Data Sources** page lets you upload screener files, Damodaran reference tables, and the industry lookup via drag-drop, then rebuild the in-app markets database with one click. Hidden by default.

```bash
# Choose any secret; share it only with people who should manage data.
AD_CC_ADMIN_TOKEN=your-secret-here uvicorn api.main:app --port 8000
```

The sidebar shows a `⚙ Data Sources` link when admin mode is enabled on the server. Click, paste your token once, drag files, click `↻ Rebuild`. Full design rationale in [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-04-us-cn-hk-database-integration-plan.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-04-us-cn-hk-database-integration-plan.md) (§6e–§6h).

Without the env var set, all admin endpoints return 404 and the sidebar link stays hidden — safe default for public deployments.

## 🧠 Why this exists

Damodaran's work is a public good — he literally publishes his spreadsheets, his lecture notes, and his valuation datasets for free on the NYU Stern website. He's been doing this for decades.

But the spreadsheets are opaque. A DCF hidden in Excel is a black box to everyone except its author. And for a global model — one that actually handles the fact that Lenovo reports in USD but trades in HKD, or that Alibaba reports in CNY but lists its ADR in USD — Excel is the wrong tool.

This project brings the *Ginzu* framework into a stack where:
- The math is **testable** (83 unit tests, and counting)
- The assumptions are **interactive** (methodology dropdowns that actually change outputs)
- The provenance is always **one hover away** (every cell explains itself)
- The data is **substitutable** (CIQ, Bloomberg, FactSet, your internal systems — if it produces the schema, it works)

Built as a tribute to an educator who gave away his life's work. Open-sourced to pay that forward.

## 🛣 Roadmap

- [ ] One-click cloud deployment (Fly.io / Railway / Render templates)
- [ ] Multi-story DCF — replicate Ginzu's NVDA-style three-business valuation (closes the ~5% VPS gap above)
- [ ] Scenario manager — save "Bull" / "Base" / "Bear" assumption sets; compare side-by-side
- [ ] Monte Carlo on assumption distributions (what's the P(VPS > market price)?)
- [ ] Historical-backtest mode — "what did my DCF say 3 years ago, and was I right?"
- [ ] More data-source adapters (Alpha Vantage / Yahoo Finance shim for casual use)
- [ ] Multi-business β (EV-weighted β across segment industries)
- [ ] Sector-specific templates (banks, REITs, insurance have different bridge logic)
- [ ] Screenshot gallery + demo GIFs in the README

## 🤝 Contributing

See [**CONTRIBUTING.md**](CONTRIBUTING.md). TL;DR: run the tests, keep PRs atomic, update the methodology docs when you change calculations.

Good first issues:
- Expand [`knowledge_base/segment_aliases.json`](knowledge_base/segment_aliases.json) with more broad-region composites
- Add currency-symbol rendering for more ISO codes (TRY, ILS, PHP, etc.)
- Translate any of the methodology docs to other languages
- Add screenshots or short demo GIFs to the `docs/screenshots/` directory
