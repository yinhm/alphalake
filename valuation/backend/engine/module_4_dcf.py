"""
Module 4: Intrinsic Valuation (DCF) — Ginzu-faithful implementation.

Projects FCFF through high-growth and transition periods per ginzu_spec_v2.md §6,
computes Gordon terminal value, discounts at a year-by-year cumulative factor,
applies failure probability to value_as_going_concern BEFORE the equity bridge,
then bridges to equity using the full Stage 9 formula:

    equity = value_of_operating_assets - debt - minority + cash_usable + cross_holdings

Key mechanics that differ from the previous implementation:
  - Operating Income = Revenue × Margin (NOT compounded EBIT)
  - Margin path linearly converges from operating_margin_next_year to target over K years
  - Tax path: flat effective for years 1–5, linear convergence to marginal for 6–10
  - Dynamic NOL carryforward with NOPAT = EBIT − max(0, EBIT−NOL_start) × rate
  - Reinvestment = ΔRevenue / Sales-to-Capital with lag (0–3 years)
  - WACC path: flat for years 1–5, linear convergence to terminal for 6–10
  - Cumulative discount factors built year-by-year
  - Terminal WACC default = riskfree + ERP (proxy for Damodaran mature_market_erp)
  - Terminal ROIC default = terminal WACC (no excess returns)
  - Failure overlay applied to value_as_going_concern BEFORE bridge
  - Failure tie-to "B" uses (bv_equity + bv_debt) × proceeds_pct
  - Trapped cash adjustment to cash_usable
